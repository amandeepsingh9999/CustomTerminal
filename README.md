# 1. ZSH
In Explaining with simple words i will tell you what is zsh . zsh stands for z - shell it is basically used for plugins and themeing our terminal.
we will install it in ubuntu :
```
sudo apt install zsh
```
and if you are using another OS you can use their package manager to install it simply , let me put a example for, 
For Arch linux:
```
sudo pacman -S zsh
```
Now that we are done with zsh installation.

we will install **Oh-my-zsh** just run this command to install :\
Curl
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
Wget
```
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```
